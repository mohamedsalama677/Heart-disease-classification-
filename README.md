# Heart Disease Classification  

## Overview  
This project builds a machine learning model to predict heart disease in patients using various health metrics. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.  

## Features  
- **Comprehensive Health Metrics**: Uses features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and ECG results.  
- **Multiple Classification Models**: Trains and evaluates models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves approximately 85% accuracy on test data.  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values.  
   - Encoding categorical variables.  
   - Feature scaling.  
2. **Model Training**  
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.  
   - Training various classifiers.  
3. **Evaluation**  
   - Comparing performance metrics.  
   - Selecting the best-performing model for deployment.  

## Dataset  
- **Heart Disease Dataset**: Includes key cardiovascular health indicators.  

## Installation  

### Prerequisites
